# DL- Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM
To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## DESIGN STEPS
Data Preparation – Load the MNIST dataset and normalize the images.

Noise Addition – Add random Gaussian noise to the images for training.

Model Design – Build a Convolutional Autoencoder with encoder and decoder layers.

Training Process – Use MSE Loss and Adam Optimizer to minimize reconstruction error.

Visualization – Display original, noisy, and denoised images to evaluate performance.



## RESULT
Thus autoencoder or image denoising have been executed successfully
